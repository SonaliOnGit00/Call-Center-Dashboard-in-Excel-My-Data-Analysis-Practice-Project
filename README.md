# Call-Center-Dashboard-in-Excel-My-Data-Analysis-Practice-Project
Built an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze agent performance and call metrics using pivot tables, slicers, and charts. Inspired by Chandoo’s tutorial, this project helped me improve my skills in data visualization, KPI tracking, and dashboard design.

## Project Flow
### Overview & Planning
The video starts with a demo of the final call‑centre dashboard, setting expectations for what you'll build

### Data Structure
Presents the dataset and explains each table (agent performance, call metrics, time stamps).

### Cleanup & Preparation
Converts raw tables into structured Excel Tables, checks for missing values, and formats columns.

### Pivot Tables
Creates multiple pivot tables to summarize key metrics: calls handled, average call duration, resolution rate over time.

### Interactive Visuals
Builds pivot charts (line, bar) and integrates slicers—by agent, call type, date range—for user-driven filtering.

### Dashboard Layout & Formatting
Assembles the visual elements cohesively, ensuring alignment, consistency, and intuitive flow.

### Final Touches
Adds labels, conditional formatting, and slicer styles to enhance usability and clarity.

### Performance-Based Questions Explored in the Dashboard
1. Which agents are handling the highest number of calls consistently?
2. How does average call duration vary across agents and call types?
3. Are resolution rates improving over time or declining?
4. Do specific agents struggle with certain call types more than others?
5. Is there a pattern between long call duration and unresolved calls?
6. How evenly is workload distributed among agents?

### Final Summary
This tutorial equips you with a robust, interactive Excel-based framework to analyze call centre operations—covering data prep, pivot logic, visual storytelling, and actionable insights. It’s a great model for building dashboards that add real business value.
